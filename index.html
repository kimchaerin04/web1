    It is an information retrieval system that allows users to search
    for information on the Internet in hypertext and multimedia environments.
    It is most widely available worldwide as a system that effectively
    retrieves various information on the Internet expressed in hypertext format.

    Hypertext appears to be a program called a web browser that reads pieces
    of information, such as "documents" or web pages, from a web server
    and outputs them to a computer monitor.
    The user can then follow the hyperlink on each page to another document
    or send a series of information to the server that is serving the page.
    Moving along hyperlinks is often referred to as web surfing or web browsing.
    And a collection of web pages containing relevant content is called a website.

    The English word "worldwide" is usually used as a single word without spaces or hyphens,
    but the word "world wide web" and its abbreviation "www" are official English words.
